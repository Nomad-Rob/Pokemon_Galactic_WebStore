Writeups of the design


What is it your are going to build and how does it fit the theme?

The theme we were given is a “Galactic Market” to make our Custom
API from scratch. With this in mind we are going to build a Pokémon
themed marketplace. The user will be given a currency on signup and every
24 hours after when they login to buy Pokémon from our marketplace.
The marketplace holds 100 random pokemon that are assigned levels, moves,
abilities, etc… that circulate every 24 hours. The user will be able to see
what pokemon they have bought and also research Pokémon from Pokémon
generations 1-8. There also will be some items that we liked from the Pokémon world to view.


What tools will you use?

For this project we will be using Firebase to host our side,
Firebase database/storage, Firebase Functions, Node, and React as our
main tech stack. This allows a steep learning curve in a short time to
learn React and how serverless functions work with Firebase Functions.




How long do you expect to spend on development of each part?

Initially we gave ourselves 7 days to have the backend built out
and 7 days for the frontend to be built out even though we know
this wasn't a huge requirement. Throughout the frontend being built
this would allow us to modify and adapt our backend as necessary to meet the goal of a nice frontend.
